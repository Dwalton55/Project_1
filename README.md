Project 1
Overview
For project #1, I created a simple game of Simon says.

Once players come to the site, they are greeted by Simon and Simeon, two monkey brothers who want to play. The player starts by selecting a game mode, either music mode or new game. They then must then defeat Simeon by helping Simon select the proper colors. Once a player wins a round, their score increases. The game allows players to play multiple games and reset the score.
